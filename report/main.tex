Used in IEEE 802.11n-2009 (Wi-Fi), 10GB Ethernet and 5G, \acrshort{ldpc} codes
are starting to replace Turbo Codes in systems with a large \textit{code rate}.
In this work, we study \acrfull{ldpc} in two channels: the \acrfull{bec} and the
\acrfull{bmc}. To quantify the performance of the codes, we will compute their
\acrfull{ber} $P_e$ and \acrfull{bler} $P_b$.

\paragraph{Implementation} The LDPC decoding and code generation were
implemented in \texttt{Rust}. All the code is thoroughly documented and can be
accessed at this address TODO. The commands associated to each figure in the
report are described in the \texttt{readme.md} file.

\section*{Conclusion}
In this work, we simulated two families of \acrshort{ldpc} codes: Gallager codes
and Mac Kay \& Neal codes on the \acrshort{bmc} channel. We showed that Mac Kay
\& Neal codes are a more powerful family of codes that Gallager types, at the
cost of a more complicated generation process.

\appendix

\section{BEC channel}

Even though we did not study them in this report, the code contains functions to
perform the same analysis on the \acrshort{bec} channel.
