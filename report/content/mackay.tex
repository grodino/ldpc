\section{MacKay \& Neal LDPC codes}
Mac kay \& Neal codes are a class of code that can be generated with rank and
non-regular degree distribution constraints (contrary to Gallager codes).

\subsection{Generation}
The generation of such codes is done iteratively on the columns of the parity
check matrix $\bm{H}$. Assuming that the first $j$ columns have been generated,
we randomly draw a column $\bm{\tilde{h}}$ with degree $\bm{d_v}[j+1]$. If the
row degree constraints are satisfied up until the column $j+1$, then
$\bm{h}_{j+1} \leftarrow \bm{\tilde{h}}$, else, retry. To ensure convergence, a
backtracking mechanism is used. A maximum number of retries $n_\text{retry}$ is
set. If it is reach while trying to generate a column $j + 1$, then we erase the
last $t$ columns and restart from $j - t$.

Therefore, there are two parameters to set in this algorithm: the number of
retries $n_\text{retry}$ and the backtracking depth $t$. A rule of thumb for the
number of retries is the following. If we want to create a column with $M$
coefficients and degree $d_v$, there are $\binom{M}{d_v}$ possibilities. The
number of retries should be of the order of this value (which can get pretty
large). However, for large code sizes, this method quickly becomes intractable
(the number of combinations explodes). The backtracking depth is arbitrarily set
to $1 + N/3$.

\subsection{Montecarlo simulation on the BMC channel}

The objective of this part is to study the effect of the irregularity of the
degree distribution and rank of Mac Kay \& Neal codes on their performance in
terms of \acrshort{ber} and \acrshort{bler}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Regular Mac Kay \& Neal codes}
First, we consider codes with a regular degree distribution as for Gallager
codes (\autoref{sec:gallager_codes}). The results are plotted in
\autoref{fig:mackay_regular_bmc}. First, we observe that despite having a much
lower length than the studied Gallager codes ($N=192$), there performance are
comparable.

        the codes have a rate of $2/3$. When the (bit or block) error
        probability is zero, the corresponding point is masked. The codes are
        characterized by their average row and column degree%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Irregular Mac Kay \& Neal codes}
Now, we consider a class of irregular Mac Kay \& Neal codes. The considered
degree distributions are created in two steps :
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start with a regular degree distribution $\bm{{d_c}}_j = d_c$ and
          $\bm{{d_v}}_i = d_v$.
    \item Increase the degree of $n_D$ codewords by an amount $D$. To satisfy
          the total degree equation ($\sum_j \bm{{d_c}}_j = \sum_i
              \bm{{d_v}}_i$), do the same with the degree of bit nodes.
\end{enumerate}
In the following experiments (\autoref{fig:mackay_bmc}), we chose $D = 3$ and
$n_D = 10$. We can observe that the irregularity in the degree distribution
increases the performance of the codes by a small margin.

\subsubsection{Irregular full rank Mac Kay \& Neal codes}
In this last experiment, we study the effect of having a full rank parity check
matrix $\bm{H}$. Observing \autoref{fig:mackay_full-rank_bmc}, there is little
difference with Mac Kay codes without rank constraints.
